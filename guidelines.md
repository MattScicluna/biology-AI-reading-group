Thank you for volunteering to present at the Biology-AI reading group (or for considering it)! Below are some tips for making a great presentation.

### Know your audience

You will be presenting to machine learning enthusiasts with varying levels of biology knowledge. You should assume that many people have minimal background in biology / your chosen field of biology. Making your presentation accessible will come down to choosing an accessible paper, filling in any missing biology gaps during your presentation introduction, and centering the discussion around the machine learning aspects of the paper.

### Choosing a paper

1. Papers should have content that is exciting from a machine learning perspective. This may include:    
  - New algorithms that have been developed specifically with biological applications in mind
  - A novel application of machine learning within the domain of biology
  - New biological datasets or data processing techniques that are expected to have a significant impact on machine learning applications <a/>
<br />
<br />
2. Avoid choosing a medical or neuroscience related AI paper for this reading group, as specific reading groups at Mila already exist for those fields. As an example of trying to distinguish between biology vs. medicine, you should consider whether the is paper applying an established technique to a clinical use case (not appropriate for this reading group) vs developing a new algorithm using human-derived data as a test case (ok).

3. Avoid papers that go into excrutiatingly complicated technical details about the biology of a system. For such papers, there is a very good chance that reading group attendees will not understand it and/or will not read it and/or will not show up to your presentation. 

If you're not sure whether a given paper is a good candidate for this reading group, please send me (Natasha) an email.

### Presenting a paper

- If you are presenting a paper from the literature: presentations should be ~20 minutes long. Discussion will follow.  
- If you are presenting your own work: the format is flexible but you should not exceed 50 minutes. This will allow for a Q&A period at the end.
- Please let the group know whether you will accept questions as the talk progresses or if all questions should be kept until the end.
- If you would like to practice setting up slides for presentation prior to the meeting (recommended), contact me and we can do a dry run a few minutes before the meeting starts. 

Introduction: <br />
It is strongly recommended that in addition to summarizing the paper's introduction you add some extra details about the biology of the system for people who aren't necessarily experts in this specific domain of biology. Be sure to clearly outline what the problem is the authors are trying to address with their work.

Methods + Results: <br />
Focus on the novel machine learning aspects, even if you've choosen a paper where the results section focuses heavily on the biology side of things.

Discussion: <br />
In addition to summarizing the author's discussion, please prepare a couple of discussion points for the group to mull over.
