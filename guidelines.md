Thank you for volunteering to present at the Biology-AI reading group! Below are some tips for making a great presentation.

### Know your audience

You will be presenting to machine learning enthusiasts with varying levels of biology knowledge. You should assume that many people have minimal background in biology / your chosen field of biology. Making your presentation accessible will come down to choosing an accessible paper, filling in any missing biology gaps during your presentation introduction, and centering the discussion around the machine learning aspects of the paper.

### Choosing a paper

1. Papers should have content that is exciting from a machine learning perspective. This may include:    
  - New algorithms that have been developed specifically with biological applications in mind
  - A novel application of machine learning within the domain of biology
  - New biological datasets or data processing techniques that are expected to have a significant impact on machine learning applications </br>

2. Do not choose a medical AI or neuroscience paper for this reading group. As an example trying to distinguish between biology vs. medicine, you should consider whether is the paper applying a technique to a clinical use case.

3. Avoid papers that go into excrutiatingly complicated technical details about the biology of a system. For such papers, there is a very good chance that reading group attendees will not understand it and/or will not read it and/or will not show up to your presentation. 

If you're not sure whether a given paper is a good candidate for this reading group, please don't hesitate to send me (Natasha) an email!

### Presenting a paper

Presentations should be ~10-15 minutes long. Slides are recommended. If you would like to practice setting up slides for presentation on Zoom, contact me (Natasha) and we can do a dry run before the meeting starts. 

Introduction:
It is strongly recommended that in addition to summarizing the paper's introduction you add some extra details about the biology of the system for people who aren't necessarily experts in this specific domain of biology. Be sure to clearly outline what the problem is the authors are trying to address with their work since this might not be apparent to domain outsiders.

Methods + Results: 
It is best to focus on the machine learning aspects here, even if you've choosen a paper that applies a machine learning algorithm to a novel biology application and the results in the actual paper largely focus on how cool those results are for biologists.

Discussion:
In addition to summarizing the author's discussion, please prepare a couple of discussion points for the group to mull over.
