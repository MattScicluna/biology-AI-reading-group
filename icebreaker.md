## Trivia game for the Fall social

### Goal 
Answer as many CS/biology/Montreal-themed questions as possible. The person with the most correct answers will win a prize! <br />

*Note: to be eligible to win the prize, you must provide an address on the island of Montreal where it can be dropped off in the next week. If you are not eligible to win the prize, you are still welcome to play for fun but please do not submit your sheet for scoring at the end.*

### How it works
1. Download a PDF with the trivia questions. There are several different versions. You must choose your version based on the first letter of your last name (below). Contestants playing with the wrong version will be disqualified.
2. Fill in the questions either based on your own knowledge or by asking others at the meeting for help. No internet searches allowed. If you don't understand one of the questions, ask Natasha for clarification.
3. When the meeting is over, send your filled out trivia sheet to Natasha for scoring (firstname@lastname.org). The winner will be contacted within the next week and announced on the RG's schedule entry for Sept 3.
