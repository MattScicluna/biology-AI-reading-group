## Research roundtable

Come learn about ML + biology research underway in the Mila ecosystem and chat with people working at the intersection of the two fields! 

Note: If you are actively looking for collaborators, datasets, etc., this is a great opportunity to crowdsource and network. 

How it works
1. We will gather via Google Meet, as per usual
2. Attendees are welcome, but not required, to briefly present what they work on (must be at the interface of ML + biology)
3. After each presentation, there will be a brief Q&A discussion period

Presenter instructions
- Research at any stage is welcome, from recently published work to half-baked ideas
- Presentations should not substantially exceed 5 minutes. There is no limit on how short they should be (e.g.: if you just want to put an idea out there)
- Slides are welcome but not required
- To ensure that timing of the event works out, please confirm your participation with Natasha Dudek (firstname @ lastname .org) by May 4th at the latest
