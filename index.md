### Who we are

The Biology-AI reading group discusses papers at the intersection of biology and AI. This includes a broad range of biology disciplines (ecology, evolutionary biolgy, physiology, conservation biology, bioinformatics, genomics, metagenomics, etc) and machine learning methods. 

Our scope does not include medical or neuroscience related papers (see: [Medical reading group](https://github.com/ieee8023/medical-reading-group) and [Neural-AI reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/neural-ai/home?authuser=0)).

### When and how we meet

During Summer 2020 we will be meeting once every two weeks on Tuesdays from 2-3pm via Zoom calls. **Please be respectful to the speaker and the other attendees and arrive a couple of minutes early**, just as you would for an in-person presentation. Meetings will begin at 2pm sharp.

For specific dates please refer to the schedule.

### Meeting format

At each meeting a group member will present a paper. **It is critical that all attendees read the paper before the meeting**.

The speaker will prepare a short (10-15 minute) presentation of the paper. **It is extremely important that speakers thoroughly present the biology of their system in sufficient detail such that members of the group with no background in that field of biology can understand their choosen paper.** It is virtually guaranteed that attendees of any given meeting will not all have the same biology background. Presenters should prepare a few (~5) discussion points. Ideally attendees will also come prepared with observations and comments about the paper for discussion.

Following the presentation there will be two phases of discussion:
1. We will split up into Zoom breakout rooms for small discussions for ~15-20 minutes.
2. We will regroup for concluding discussion and remarks.

### Guidelines for choosing a paper

1. Keep in mind that your audience is a machine learning crowd. Papers should have content that is exciting from a machine learning perspective and should lead to an interesting discussion on machine learning. This may include:    
  - New algorithms that have been developed specifically with biological applications in mind
  - A novel application of machine learning within the domain of biology
  - Brand new biological datasets or data processing techniques that are expected to have a significant impact on machine learning applications. 

2. Please do not choose a medical AI or neuroscience paper for this reading group. As an example of a guideline for the biology vs. medicine distinction, you should consider whether is the paper applying a technique to a clinical use case (e.g.: using ML to diagnose a disease based on gene expression levels). If so, its medical. In contrast, if the paper focuses on developing a novel, broad-purpose algorithm or gaining a deeper understand of how biological systems work, you're probably in the clear.

3. In some cases it may be helpful to send along a second, supporting paper or a resource that *briefly* explains the biology behind your system. 

4. If at any point you want a second opinion on whether a given paper is a good candidate, please feel welcome to send Natasha an email :)
