### Who we are

The Biology-AI reading group discusses papers at the intersection of biology and AI. This includes a broad range of biology disciplines (ecology, evolutionary biolgy, physiology, conservation biology, bioinformatics, genomics, metagenomics, etc) and machine learning methods. Our scope does not include medical or neuroscience related papers (see: [Medical reading group] (https://github.com/ieee8023/medical-reading-group) and [Neural-AI reading group] (https://sites.google.com/view/neural-ai/home?authuser=0)).

### When and how we meet

During Summer 2020 we will be meeting once every two weeks on Tuesdays from 2-3pm via Zoom calls. **Meetings will start at exactly 2pm (not 2:05)** so please be respectful to the speaker and arrive a couple of minutes early, just as you would for an in-person presentation. For specific dates please refer to the schedule.

### Meeting format

At each meeting a group member will present a paper. **It is critical that all attendees read the paper before the meeting**.

The speaker will prepare a short (10-15 minute) presentation of the paper. **It is extremely important that speakers thoroughly present the biology of their system in sufficient detail such that members of the group with no background in that field of biology can understand the significance of their choosen paper.** It is virtually guaranteed that attendees of any given meeting will not all have the same biology background. Presenters should prepare a few (~5) discussion points. Ideally attendees will also come prepared with observations and comments about the paper for discussion.

Following the presentation there will be two phases of discussion:
1. We will split up into Zoom breakout rooms for small discussions for ~15-20 minutes.
2. We will regroup for concluding discussion and remarks.

### Guidelines for choosing a paper

1. Keep in mind that your audience is a machine learning crowd. Papers should have content that is exciting from a machine learning perspective and should lead to an interesting discussion on machine learning. This may include a) new algorithms that have been developed specifically with biological applications in mind, b) a novel application of machine learning within the domain of biology, or c) new biological datasets that are available for machine learning applications. Please avoid papers that do not make novel and/or significant contributions to either the discoverey of new machine learning techniques or new scientific insights E.g.: there are already countless papers that use [your favourite algorithm] to classify images of various species (spider classifier, bird classifier, mushroom classifier, etc). Please don't choose a paper that applies the same methodology to images of [your favourite species] or that somehow increases performance by 0.00001%. There won't be much for the reading group to discuss. Conversely, if there is a new ML algorithm / technique used or something special about the data / insights produced, then it would be an interesting paper for discussion.

2. Please do not choose a medical AI or neuroscience paper for this reading group. There is, of course, some overlap between biology, medicine, and neuroscience. As an example of a guideline for the biology - medicine distinction, you should consider whether is the paper applying a technique to a clinical use case. If so, its medical. For example, using ML to diagnose a disease based on gene expression levels is clinical and should not be presented in this reading group. In contrast, using an ML algorithm to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind how gene expression levels in general are regulated is a good candidate for this reading group. If you aren't sure whether a given paper counts as being medicine or neuroscience, please don't hestitate to send me (Natasha) an email.
