### Description

The Mila Biology + AI reading group discusses papers at the intersection of biology and AI. While one of the key themes of the reading group is machine learning applications in bioinformatics, we welcome machine learning-related papers dealing with any branch of biology, including ecology, evolutionary biology, conservation biology, physiology, etc.

Our reading group is open to anyone working on a problem at the intersection of these fields, or who is interested in doing so. Expertise in both biology and machine learning is not necessary, although an interest in both is! We want to create a place where people in this space can get to know each other, and form potentially fruitful collaborations.

Our scope does not typically include medical or neuroscience related papers (see: [Medical reading group](https://github.com/ieee8023/medical-reading-group) and [Neural-AI reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/neural-ai/home?authuser=0)).

### When and how we meet

During Summer 2022, we are experimenting with a hybrid format. You can visit us in Auditorium 2 of 6650 Rue Saint-Urbain (the Mila building). Alternatively, you can watch the talk live via Blue Jeans (or Zoom).

We will be meeting once every two weeks, usually from 3-4 pm. **Please be respectful to the speaker and the other attendees and arrive a couple of minutes early**, just as you would for an in-person presentation. Meetings will begin at 3 pm sharp.

For specific dates please refer to the schedule.

### Meeting format

Option A) A group member will present a paper from the literature (~20 min). Following the presentation there will be a discussion.

Option B) A speaker will present their own work to the group (length flexible, max. 50 minutes). Following the presentation there will be a discussion.

**It is critical that all attendees read the paper before the meeting**. Both the presenter and attendees should come prepared with observations and comments about the paper for discussion.

### Staying up to date 

[Join our Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biology-ai-reading-group) for reminders about upcoming presentations. To be accepted, you must add a short note (1-2 sentences) about who you are to the join request.
