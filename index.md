### Description

The Mila Biology + AI reading group discusses papers at the intersection of biology and AI. This includes a broad range of biology disciplines (bioinformatics, genomics, ecology, evolutionary biology, physiology, conservation biology, etc) and machine learning methods. 

Our scope does not include medical or neuroscience related papers (see: [Medical reading group](https://github.com/ieee8023/medical-reading-group) and [Neural-AI reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/neural-ai/home?authuser=0)).

### When and how we meet

During Fall 2020 we will be meeting once every two weeks on Thursdays from 4-5 pm via Google Meet. **Please be respectful to the speaker and the other attendees and arrive a couple of minutes early**, just as you would for an in-person presentation. Meetings will begin at 4 pm sharp.

For specific dates please refer to the schedule.

### Meeting format

Option A) A group member will present a paper from the literature (~20 min). Following the presentation there will be a discussion.

Option B) A speaker will present their own work to the group (length flexible, max. 50 minutes). Following the presentation there will be a discussion.

**It is critical that all attendees read the paper before the meeting**. Both the presenter and attendees should come prepared with observations and comments about the paper for discussion.
