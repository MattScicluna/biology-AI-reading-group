### Description

The Biology-AI reading group discusses papers at the intersection of biology and AI. This includes a broad range of biology disciplines (ecology, evolutionary biolgy, physiology, conservation biology, bioinformatics, genomics, metagenomics, etc) and machine learning methods. 

Our scope does not include medical or neuroscience related papers (see: [Medical reading group](https://github.com/ieee8023/medical-reading-group) and [Neural-AI reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/neural-ai/home?authuser=0)).

### When and how we meet

During Summer 2020 we will be meeting once every two weeks on Tuesdays from 2-3 pm via Google Meet. **Please be respectful to the speaker and the other attendees and arrive a couple of minutes early**, just as you would for an in-person presentation. Meetings will begin at 2 pm sharp.

For specific dates please refer to the schedule.

### Meeting format

At each meeting a group member will present a paper. **It is critical that all attendees read the paper before the meeting**. Both the presenter and attendees should come prepared with observations and comments about the paper for discussion.

The speaker will prepare a short (10-15 minute) presentation of the paper. 

Following the presentation there will be two phases of discussion:
1. We will split up into breakout rooms for small discussions for ~15-20 minutes.
2. We will regroup for concluding discussion and remarks.
